		 <p><b>Hello Friends,</b><br>
		 Welcome to my online portfolio, where I will be telling you a bit about me aswell as showcase some of my work.<br>
		 I like to think of myself as one of the hard workers amongst my peers..<br> I would always try and go out of my way to help fellow co-workers and finish all tasks to the best of my ability.<br>

		 I am very ambitious and always set a high standard for myself. When comes to my skills in the developing world <br>I specialize in HTML,CSS and some JavaScript and I am very passoinate about Design.<br>
		 The reason Design is important to me is because I like seeing things in my own context and try <br>and set myself apart from others. I also come from an Arts school where I had Visual Art as a subject and it taught me alot <br>about the design world.</p>
